# Exploratory data analysis of Olympics ‘21

This project is part of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ITCS - 6162) course from University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

## Introduction:
Olympics are one of the main International Event and a matter of prestige for countries as more than 200 countries participate and compete. Olympics is held every 4 years but due to the pandemic Olympics 2020 was postponed to 2021. The purpose of our project is to perform visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset. We can analyse an entity based on the factors contributing to it. We will perform correlations among the athletes, coaches, gender, medal, and teams participated in olympics’21 to obtain interesting patterns which in turn are used to derive useful insights for the upcoming Olympics.

## About data:
The dataset is related to the 2021(2020) Tokyo Olympic games. Details of 11,000 athletes in 47 disciplines, along with 743 Teams taking part in it.
This dataset contains the details of the Participants, Teams, and Coaches participating. It has details such as names, discipline, gender of competitors, countries they represent, and the name of their coaches.
The dataset also contains details regarding the medals tally of each Team /Country.

Athletes.xlsx - 3 features.  
Coaches.xlsx - 3 features.  
EntriesGender.xlsx - 4 features.  
Medals.xlsx - 4 features.  

The goal of this project is to use proper visualizing techniques and appropriate representation to get meaningful insights out of this data.

## Research questions:
1. Which country has the highest number of participants in Olympics 2021 overall?
A bubble map chart is used to represent the relationship between number of participants and country. From this map, we can extract information about the country with the highest/least number of participants.
 
2. Which country has the highest number of participants in each sport in Olympics 2021 ?
A bubble map chart is used to represent the relationship between the number of participants in each sport and country. From this map, we can extract information about the country with highest/least participation in each sport.

3. Which gender has more participation in a given sport?
A grouped bar chart is used to show the number of women and men participants in each sport. This map can be used to get information about which sport has the highest/lowest women/men participants.

4. Countries and number of gold, silver and bronze medals.
A stacked bar chart is used to show the number of gold, silver and bronze medals won by each country. From this map, we can get information about countries with maximum number of medals, least number of medals, maximum/least number of gold/silver/bronze medals.

5. Which country has the highest number of coaches?
A point map is used to show the number of coaches in each country. We can obtain information about the country that has the highest and lowest number of coaches using this map.

## Future work:
This analysis can be used for future prediction of the participation of countries, analyse the growth of the countries’ athletes, and to strategize and improve the performance of a particular country. Moreover, by doing so we can improve the quality and experience of the Olympic games.
